# OSD600-Journey-on-rocky-trails
This is a command line tool that takes a file as input, reads and finds http:// and https:// links throughout the file and tells the user which ones are working and which ones are broken.

The tool will output all of the links with a red "BAD",  and a rainbow "GOOD"
